# Database Application Development Assignments

## Introduction
This repository contains my assignments and projects for the Database Application Development course as part of my Masters program at University of Alabama at Birmingham. The repository is a collection of various database applications and solutions I developed during the course.

## Course Information

## Contents
- ER to Relations Tables: This assignment involves two key components: first, revising an E/R diagram to identify flight bookings using specific criteria and converting this into a relational database schema, and second, applying different methods (straight-E/R, object-oriented, and nulls) to convert another E/R diagram into a relational schema. Additionally, it includes practical SQL tasks like manipulating data in database tables and importing data from a text file.
- ER Basics: This assignment involves exploring various types of entity-relationship (E-R) models. This includes creating unique examples of binary relationships (many-to-many, many-to-one, one-to-one), developing multiway E-R relationships, and illustrating an ISA hierarchy.
- Identify Data Redundancy and Update Anomalies: Assignment on identifying data redundancy and anomalies (update, insert, delete) in spreadsheets, using a scenario where employee-manager relationships are tracked. It focuses on understanding and explaining inconsistencies arising from spreadsheet management, specifically in the context of non-null employee and manager fields, and the implications of using names as unique identifiers.
- PostgreSQL Basics Practice: assignment focused on database manipulation and management using PostgreSQL. The tasks include importing data into a 'weather' table, adding tuples to a 'cities' table, executing join statements, updating and deleting table contents, adding new columns, and managing foreign key constraints.
- Relational Algebra: Assignment on relational algebra, focusing on applying various relational algebra operations to solve database queries. The assignment requires understanding and demonstrating proficiency in key concepts such as selection, projection, joins, set operations, and more, using theoretical and practical database scenarios.
- Relational Data Model Components: Assignment focusing on understanding the structure and components of relational databases, specifically through instances of banking database relations. It covers identifying attributes and tuples of two relations (Accounts and Customers), defining their relation schemas, detailing the database schema, and determining suitable domains for each attribute. The assignment emphasizes foundational concepts in database design and management.
- SQL Queries: assignment that involves creating tables and executing various SQL queries based on a PostgreSQL database schema, as outlined in a textbook. The tasks include dealing with dangling tuples, and writing SQL queries for different scenarios, like finding ship classes involved in battles, analyzing battleship data, and calculating averages and specific statistics. Emphasis is placed on precise query formulation, understanding database relationships, and interpreting query results.
